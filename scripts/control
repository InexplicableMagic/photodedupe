Description: Identifies duplicate photos regardless of scale or file format.
 Photodedupe is a command line utility for identifying duplicate photos 
 regardless of whether the images have been scaled or have differing
 file formats. It compares the image content visually and does not rely
 on metadata or file hashes to perform the de-duplication.
